# Mount Everest Challenge
Welcome to the portfolio page for the **Mount Everest Challenge** app.

Designed to help people stay fit while isolating at home, this app counts your steps as you climb or walk. There are many achievements to be earned as you make your way to the peak of Mount Everest.

During development, the app was extended to include other sports: Cycling (Tour de France) and Walking (Appalachian Trail) challenges were added.

Developed as an MVP app in Flutter (and closed source for now) by [@bababash](https://github.com/bababash) and [@phonenixinwater](https://github.com/phoenixinwater).
